# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset Analysis

This project showcases end‑to‑end data analysis and modelling using the
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.  The dataset, included in
scikit‑learn, contains measurements from fine‑needle aspirate (FNA) images
of breast masses.  Each of the 569 samples has 30 numeric features and a
binary label indicating whether the tumour is malignant or benign.  According
to the scikit‑learn documentation, the dataset contains two classes with
212 malignant and 357 benign samples (569 total) and 30 positive‑valued
features【154549963299770†L679-L701】.

## Objectives

1. **Load and store data:** Load the dataset into a pandas `DataFrame` and
   persist it to an SQLite database.  Using SQL for data storage makes
   aggregations and queries reproducible and demonstrates database skills.
2. **Explore the data:** Compute summary statistics in SQL (e.g., mean of
   selected features grouped by diagnosis).  Use Python to compute a
   correlation matrix and visualise it as a heatmap.
3. **Build a model:** Train a logistic regression classifier to predict
   tumour malignancy.  Evaluate the model using a hold‑out test set,
   reporting accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

## Dataset overview

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is a well‑known
classification benchmark.  Its main characteristics are:

- **Classes:** two (malignant and benign)【154549963299770†L679-L701】.
- **Samples per class:** 212 malignant, 357 benign【154549963299770†L679-L701】.
- **Total samples:** 569【154549963299770†L679-L701】.
- **Dimensionality:** 30 numeric features【154549963299770†L679-L701】.
- **Features:** real, positive values computed from FNA images【154549963299770†L679-L701】.

The `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer` function downloads a copy of the
dataset and returns it as a dictionary‑like object.  Setting
`as_frame=True` converts it to a pandas `DataFrame` for easier
manipulation.

### Key outputs

- **`correlation_heatmap.png`** – Visualises pairwise correlations between the 30
  features.  Strong positive or negative correlations can indicate
  redundancy or multicollinearity, informing feature selection.
- **`roc_curve.png`** – Shows the trade‑off between true positive rate and
  false positive rate for the classifier.  The area under the curve (AUC)
  summarises the model’s discriminative ability.
- **SQLite database** – Storing data in `breast_cancer.db` allows you to run
  ad‑hoc SQL queries.  The example SQL in `analysis.py` computes average
  radius, texture, area and smoothness for malignant vs. benign tumours.

## Running the analysis

1. Ensure you have Python 3 with the following libraries installed:
   `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit‑learn`.
2. Navigate to the `breast_cancer_project` directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

The script will load the data, save it to `breast_cancer.db`, perform SQL
aggregations, generate the correlation heatmap and ROC curve plots, train
a logistic regression model, and print summary statistics and evaluation
metrics to the console.

## Next steps

This project can be extended by exploring other classification algorithms
(e.g., Random Forests, Support Vector Machines), performing feature
selection, or deploying the model via a web API.  You could also write
parameterised SQL queries to answer specific questions about the data, or
build interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
